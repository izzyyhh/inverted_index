# Setup

```bash
npm install
```

# Implementation

1. Add your implementation in `searcher.js`.
2. Check that tests run successfully, at least [basic.spec.js](basic.spec.js).
3. Format the code before committing your implementation to make the code easier to read.
4. Check that the build runs successfully on GitLab, at least [basic.spec.js](basic.spec.js).
5. Remove the other test files (`.spec.js`) if you choose not to implement them, but you get bonus points if you do
   implement them!

# Format code
